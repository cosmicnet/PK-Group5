## Setting up virtual environment
To avoid confusion about which versions of python and any packages are being used, it's a good idea to work in a *virtual environment*.
Here's how to set one up (be aware that dev_requirements.txt doesn't exist yet...):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r dev_requirements.txt
```

## Workflow 
checking out branch
adding and committing changes
pushing those to branch
then pull request

## Naming conventions
